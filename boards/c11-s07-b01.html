# Description of Open Set

## Neighbourhood of $ z_0 $ (Open Disc)

Set of all points $ z $ such that $ \lvert z - z_0 \rvert < r $ where
$ r > 0 $.

## Deleted Neighbourhood of $ z_0 $

Set of all points $ z $ such that $ 0 < \lvert z - z_0 \rvert < r $
where $ r > 0 $.

## Interior Point of $ S $

A point $ z_0 $ such that we can find a neighbourhood of $ z_0 $ all
of whose points belong to $ S $.

## Boundary Point of $ S $

A point $ z_0 $ such that every neighbourhood of $ z_0 $ contains
points belonging to both $ S $ and $ S^c $.

## Exterior Point of $ S $

A point $ z_0 $ that is neither an interior point nor a boundary point.

## Limit Point of $ S $

A point $ z_0 $ such that every deleted neighbourhood of $ z_0 $
contains points of $ S $. The limit point itself may or may not belong
to $ S $.

## Open Set

A set $ S $ that consists only of interior points, e.g., $ |z| < 1 $.

## Closed Set

A set $ S $ that contains all its limit points, e.g., $ |z| <= 1 $.
